## 🖱️ Virtual Mouse Controlled by Hand Gestures

This project demonstrates a computer vision-based virtual mouse system that allows users to control the mouse pointer using hand gestures. It leverages a webcam and real-time hand tracking to replicate mouse functions like moving the cursor, left-clicking, and right-clicking—completely touch-free.

### 📌 Problem Statement

To build an intuitive and contactless human-computer interaction system using hand gestures that can control the mouse, providing accessibility and hygiene benefits, especially in environments where touch-based input is limited or inconvenient.

---

### 📷 Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **OpenCV** – for video capture and image processing
* **Mediapipe** – for real-time hand tracking
* **PyAutoGUI** – to control mouse actions programmatically

---

### ⚙️ Key Features

* Cursor movement using index finger
* Left click by bringing index and thumb fingers together
* Right click using a different finger gesture (e.g., middle + index)
* Smooth pointer tracking with frame rate optimization

---

### 🧪 Future Enhancements

* Add gesture-based drag-and-drop
* Scroll control using vertical hand movement
* Voice command integration
* Multi-hand support
